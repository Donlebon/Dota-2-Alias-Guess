# How It's Made: 

<b>Tech used: </b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I am a huge fan of Dota 2 and I wanted to make an application that would combine the different things that I have learned so far during my coding journey. 

# Lessons Learned:

I was very happy when I finished my application and I learned a lot about what it takes to build a project from scratch. It takes perseverance and determination to continously adapt and update your code based on issues that arise when you least expect it too. Even though my app is far from perfect, I am proud of being able to take it this far and this project has motivated me even more to become a better software engineer.
